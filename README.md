# Custom Shaders Scene ðŸ–¥

PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE BUILDABLE PROJECT! 

This repo contains all the code I wrote myself and a build of the final version of the project which I handed in for 
this module. This code is here for showing off my work only: due to the framework abertay uni provided to make this 
coursework, the full project is too large to upload to a single github repo.

This project involved using C++ and HLSL to write a program which showed off custom shaders, build on top of a DirectX 3D
framework the university provided, which was intended to be a slice out of their own custom skateboard engine (for learning 
purposes). Learning about how shaders are made was very interesting to make, offloading processing to the graphics card 
and working with the DirectX shader pipeline. I really enjoyed working on what felt like a lower level compared to the 
rest of my uni projects so far, and even though this was the hardest module of my first term in third year (it wasn't 
even close), I am pleased to say I had an excellent time.
